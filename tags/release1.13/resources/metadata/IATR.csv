It is the most recent incarnation of software that has been used since the mid '80s at Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Morphometric Analysis to analyze coronal T1-weighted magnetic resonance brain scans. NVM is being freely released for non-commercial use so that researchers can focus on developing new abilities instead of re-inventing the basic platform. Basic features include the abilities to: load 3D image data in a variety of formats, crop and reslice scans into a normalized orientation, adjust image brightness and contrast, display data as single or multiple slices in sagittal, axial, coronal, and arbitrary oblique views with arbitrary zoom factors, and produce outlines around labeled brain regions using isointensity contours and manual drawing, and to log all user actions.|The outputs of NVM are named neuroanatomical regions represented as surfaces or outline files. The user selects from the following tools to interact with the scan: arrow (selection), contour, draw, nudge, erase, box, landmark, label, and histogram. Seven differently colored temporary 'contours' can be created using the contour tool and these are edited using the drawing tool and eraser. A click with the contour tool causes iso-intensity contours to be drawn everywhere in the slice image at the intensity of the voxel under the mouse pointer during the click. After editing, contours are extracted (or converted) into 'outlines'.|The label tool allows a text label to be assigned to a particular outline. The landmark tool is used to designate locations in the scan that are used for cropping and positional normalization. The histogram tool brings up a window showing the histogram of a region defined by an outline and a click on the histogram will generate an iso-intensity contour. 'Mid-Peak' iso-intensity contours can be generated by clicking on one peak and draggin to another. The 'AutoContour' feature associates a particular intensity value with a contour color so that when the user changes to a different slice, this contour is automatically drawn. The intensity used for a particular slice is interpolated from the values that were set in the nearest slices.|The most significant and novel feature is called 'SegMentor'. This provides on-line, context sensitive instructions, definitions, and assistance with segmentation methods using a collection of XML and HTML documents.|SegMentor records, plays, and allows viewing and editing of scripts. At the top level, these scripts are flexible lists of tasks to perform. At the lowest level, SegMentor scripts control NVM tools, provide short user reminders, and also provide context-sensitive information to the user via 'Help' buttons/menu which open a browser window to a web page containing images and definitions that describes the specific segmentation task in detail.|Segmentor scripts provide an explicit and complete definition of a particular neuroanatomical measurement method. This is important because it is not possible or desirable to fit all of the details of a method into an academic publication. Developing neuroanatomical measurement methods using SegMentor facilitates the distribution of these methods and is also invaluable in training new people to perform these methods. Moreover, Segmentor helps to automate the method, which decreases cost and increases reliability. By automating segmentation as much as possible, user input is limited to only the steps that need to be done using experience and anatomical knowledge.|A SegMentor script, along with the ability to log all user actions, provides complete documentation that can be essential to demonstrating scientific validity and to survive an FDA audit."

We recommend recent hardware (G3 and G4 desktops or portables with Firewire). The video can come from built-in sources, an add-in card, or a video camera attached to the Firewire port on Macintosh computers. Our system has been tested almost exclusively with Firewire video; however, any video digitizer whose driver implements a QuickTime vdig component should work. The code uses the Sequence Grabber to do the overlay.|Camera/Video input|Just about any video input should work (PAL, NTSC, S-video, etc.), but as a first step you will need to convert your video signal to Firewire. If you have a conventional video camera or source (VHS deck) you may want to get a Formac Studio converter box (www.formac.com; $429 list; 8/8/2001). This box will convert NTSC composite or S-video output to Firewire.|One recommended camera for direct Firewire video microscopy is the Canon XL1 MiniDV camcorder. The 3-chip camera offers simultaneous output in composite, S-video, and Firewire video formats. You will need to have an adapter machined to fit an XL1 to your microscope. Contact Rob Williams for details on the adapter we made for a Zeiss Universal that is used by the iScope.|Software Requirements QuickTime 4 or higher.

It was developed to provide a way to outline and count cells in a video image. Hardware requirements are minimal.|Using VideoScribbler|VideoScribbler is easy to use. On startup, the program displays the live video image in a 640x480 window. Simply click and drag the mouse to outline cells. When you release the mouse button, Videoscribbler will complete your outline and increment the 'Object Count' display at the bottom of the window. To clear the video image of outlines and reset the object count, choose 'Clear Counts' from the Edit menu.|The red and green frame overlaid on the video image is a standard unbiased counting frame. We use this frame to define an area in which to count cells. You can hide the counting box by selecting 'Use Counting Frame' from the Edit menu. You can resize the frame by choosing 'Frame Size' from the Edit menu. The frame size is stored in the VideoScribbler Prefs file and is preserved between sessions. If you want to move the count box to a location other than the middle of the screen, hold shift and click on the new center of the count box.|The current implementation supports drawing in only one color (video inverse) but it would be a simple matter to expand the drawing capabilities of the program."

Images at the Brain Imaging Centre are stored on disk in a format called MINC, which stands for Medical Image Net CDF. More information is available in related documentation specifically concerning this format and the MINC library of routines used to read and write MINC files. The BIC Volume IO Library is built on top of the MINC library to provide easy access to MINC files for most general operations, without having to learn too much of the details of the MINC library, which is a comprehensive system for handling most conceivable cases. The BIC Volume IO Library provides a structure for internal storage of volumes and routines to access and modify volumes.

Quantitative analysis with pre-defined atlas templates often requires the initial alignment of atlas and image planes. Unfortunately, the axial planes acquired during separate scanning sessions are often different in their relative position and orientation, and these slices are not coplanar with those in the atlas. A completely automatic method has been developed, based on multi-scale, three dimensional (3D) cross-correlation, to register a given volumetric data set to an average MRI brain (n > 300) aligned with the Talairach stereotaxic coordinate system. Once the data set is resampled by the transformation recovered by the algorithm, atlas slices can be directly super-imposed on the corresponding slices of the resampled volume (see below). The use of such a standardized space also allows the direct comparison, voxel-to-voxel, of two or more data sets brought into stereotaxic space.|A Perl script (mritotal) implements the multi-resolution fitting strategy that has been used to map more than 500 brains into stereotaxic space at the Montreal Neurological Institute. At the heart of this procedure is minctracc, the program that automatically finds the best linear transformation to map one volumetric data set (stored in MINC format, see below) on to another. The program uses optimization over a user selectable number of parameters to identify the best (according to a user-selected objective function) transformation mapping voxel values of the first data set into the second."

The package contains manual and automated tools for structural identi cation and methods for tissue classi cation and cortical surface generation. BRAINS2 is most commonly used to analyze magnetic resonance (MR) scans, but the package can also be used to analyze images acquired with positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and functional magnetic resonance (fMR).|The BRAINS2 package was developed as a replacement for the BRAINS package. (BRAINS is an acronym for Brain Research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems.) The BRAINS2 package was designed to support multiple computer platforms and was implemented in such a way that it would function like an image processing toolbox, providing image processing modules that can be linked together in many ways to achieve an almost unlimited number of image analysis strategies.|BRAINS2 takes full advantage of the latest hardware and software technology standards to allow it to be used on platforms other than the Linux and SGI systems we ourselves use. BRAINS2 uses object-oriented approaches, OpenGL, and X11 to implement the GUI. The object-oriented design speci es that BRAINS2 have speci c routines (access functions) for interaction with every object. For example, images must have the information about them obtained or set using the image object access functions.|There are three main parts to the BRAINS2 implementation: the toolbar and command line interface, the GUI, and the kernel. Using the toolbar and command line interface, the user can load, save, and operate on objects. The GUI displays viewable objects, like images, ROIs, and surfaces. The kernel is a set of image processing routines, which can be linked together through the command language. In terms of data, BRAINS2 is backward compatible with BRAINS and links together a series of processing steps to mimic the behavior of BRAINS. A fundamental set of library routines has been implemented in BRAINS2 for structural imaging."

Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data found in a digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI scanners.|Registration is the task of aligning or developing correspondences between data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to combine the information contained in both.|ITK is implemented in C++. ITK is cross-platform, using the CMake build environment to manage the compilation process. In addition, an automated wrapping process generates interfaces between C++ and interpreted programming languages such as Tcl, Java, and Python (using CableSwig). This enables developers to create software using a variety of programming languages. ITK's C++ implementation style is referred to as generic programming (i.e., using templated code). Such C++ templating means that the code is highly efficient, and that many software problems are discovered at compile-time, rather than at run-time during program execution.|Because ITK is an open-source project, developers from around the world can use, debug, maintain, and extend the software. ITK uses a model of software development referred to as extreme programming. Extreme programming collapses the usual software creation methodology into a simultaneous and iterative process of design-implement-test-release. The key features of extreme programming are communication and testing. Communication among the members of the ITK community is what helps manage the rapid evolution of the software. Testing is what keeps the software stable. In ITK, an extensive testing process (using Dart) is in place that measures the quality on a daily basis. The ITK Testing Dashboard is posted continuously reflecting the quality of the software."

The main differences between this analysis and previous ones are: a simple bias reduction and regularization for voxel-wise autoregressive model parameters; the combination of effects and their estimated standard deviations across different scans/sessions/subjects via a hierarchical random effects analysis using the EM algorithm; overcoming the problem of a small number of scans/session/subjects using a regularized variance ratio to increase the degrees of freedom. FMRIstat also implements a fast, efficient, general, simple, valid and robust method of estimating and making inference about the delay of the fMRI response modeled as a temporal shift of the hemodynamic response function (HRF). We estimate the shift unbiasedly using two optimally chosen basis functions for a spectrum of time shifted HRFs. This is done at every voxel, to create an image of estimated delays and their standard deviations. This can be used to compare delays for the same stimulus at different voxels, or for different stimuli at the same voxel."

Variously referred to as RF inhomogeneity, shading artifact, or intensity on-uniformity, it is usually attributed to such factors as poor radio frequency (RF) field uniformity, eddy currents driven by the switching of field gradients, and patient anatomy both inside and outside the field of view.|The perl script nu_correct implements a novel approach to correcting for intensity non-uniformity in MR data that achieves high performance without requiring supervision. By making relatively few assumptions about the data, the method can be applied at an early stage in an automated data analysis, before a tissue intensity or geometric model is available. Described as Non-parametric Non-uniform intensity Normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the true tissue intensities. Preprocessing of MR data using N3 has been shown to substantially improve the accuracy of anatomical analysis techniques such as tissue classification and cortical surface extraction."

SurfRelax consists of a set of programs and scripts for Unix, Cygwin, and MacOS X that extract the inner and outer cortical surfaces from a T1-weighted MR image of the human brain. The surfaces are guaranteed to be topologically equivalent to a sphere, thereby obviating the need for handle removal. SurfRelax requires no user intervention, although minor manual editing is recommended for optimal results (normally less than 10 minutes per hemisphere).|SurfRelax has several properties that compare favourably with other software packages for surface reconstruction:| - Free software| - The binaries (written in C++ and Tcl/Tk) are in the public domain. The source code will be released once legacy code issues have been resolved (i.e. replacing with GPL code).| - Uses standard public file formats: Analyze file format (SPM/FSL-compatible) for volumes and OOGL OFF binary format for surfaces (see www.geomview.org),| - Combines advantages of volumetric and surface-based methods for surface generation| - Correct topology of output surface guaranteed| - Requires little or no user intervention - no need for manual handle removal| - Relatively robust to noise - multi-scale method compensates for partial volume effects and intensity inhomogeneities| - Relatively fast (an entire brain is segmented, extracted and unfolded in less than 2 hours of CPU time),| - Powerful editing and visualization tools for volumes and surfaces| - Readily extendable - for instance for use with monkey brains or children's brains| - Can be used to visualize functional data from SPM or FSL| - Includes tools for integration with Stanford's VISTASOFT tools for FMRI data analysis (white.stanford.edu)"
