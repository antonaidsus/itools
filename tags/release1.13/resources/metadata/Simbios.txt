[edit]FEATURE
NCBC Ontology Classification: Analysis --> Imaging --> Molecular Structure 
Description: A suite of automated tools that examine biological structures and produce useful representations of the key biophysical and biochemical features of these structures that are critical for understanding function. The utility of this system extends from medical/pharmaceutical applications (model-based drug design, comparing pharmacological activities) to industrial applications (understanding structural stability, protein engineering). FEATURE is a suite of automated tools that examines biological structures. Using these structures, it produces useful representations of the key biophysical and biochemical features that are critical for understanding function.
