[edit]SVPASEG (Sub-Volume Probabilistic Atlas Segmentation)
NCBC Ontology Classification: Modeling --> Algorithms --> Image Processing --> Segmentation 
Description: Software for sub volume probabilistic atlas (SVPA) based segmentation MR brain images using inhomogeneous MRFs (Markov Random Fields). This algorithm is meant for the sub-volume-based tissue classification of the MR images. The regions (e.g. Frontal lobe, temporal lobe, etc.) are specified by a sub volume probabilistic atlas. 
Data Input: Image to be segmented (in Analyze format). The atlas specification (a new text file based format, specifying the atlas (e.g. image files of SVPA) and the fixed part of the inhomogeneous MRFs (e.g. allowed voxel labels for each atlas region). The atlas image files are in Analyze 7.5 format. The support for MINC files to be added in future. 
Data Output: Segmented image (in Analyze 7.5 format). Support for MINC to be added in future. 
Implementation Language: C/C++ 
Platform tested: The development has been carried out in Linux. 
Version, Date, Stage: The Beta version for the internal distribution was ready in Nov. 2005. The first alpha release probably during (Summer) 2006.

[edit]Debabeler
NCBC Ontology Classification: Integration --> Resource Integration Components 
Description: Neuroimaging studies often involve multiple data processing and analysis packages, each of which often use different file formats and conventions. Although "standard" file formats have been developed, no one format exists that satisfies the needs of contemporary neuroimage analyses. The LONI Debabeler acts as a data mediator between neuroimaging software packages by automatically translating data files from one format into another format. The data files are decoded and encoded using an image data plugin architecture, and the translations from one format into another are performed using an XML-based data translation automaton. The translations are visually defined and edited using the Debabeler's graphical user interface. The Debabeler provides a flexible application and configurable automaton that can be used to develop solutions to translation problems. 
Data Input: Plugins to read (decode) common imaging formats, XML, and plain text files (including almost all medical image files). 
Data Output: Plugins to write (encode) common imaging formats, XML, and plain text files. 
Implementation Language: Java (requires Java 1.4+)
