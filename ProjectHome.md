iTools is an infrastructure for managing (databasing, traversal and comparison) of diverse computational biology resources. There are 3 types of resources within iTools â€“ data, software tools and web-services. The iTools design, implementation and resource meta-data content reflect the broad research, computational, applied and scientific expertise available at the 7 <a href='http://www.NCBCs.org'>National Centers for Biomedical Computing</a>.<br>

Specifically, iTools provides an infrastructure for classification, categorization and integration of different computational biology resources across space-and-time scales, biomedical problems, computational infrastructures and mathematical foundations.<br>

A large number of resources, developed by the NCBCs and other initiatives, are already iTools-accessible to the community and this infrastructure is rapidly growing. iTools provides several flexible human and machine interfaces to its resource meta-data repository.<br>

iTools utilizes <a href='http://www.Biositemaps.org'>Biositemaps</a> as the infrastructure for storing and dissemination of meta-data about various computational biology resources.
